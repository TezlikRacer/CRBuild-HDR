# CRBuild-HDR

The Capital Region Custom HDR Build!

To install, simply drag the "ultimate" folder to the root of your SD card. The pathing is set up so it will automatically put everything in the right place.

The hdr-assets folder has a custom music UI folder which gives you the correct names for our custom music.

Please enjoy, and if you have any issues, please hit me up on discord: tezlik (they/them)#2112
